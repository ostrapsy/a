Starting off as a graduate historian, I switched to an entirely different discipline: occupational assessor trying to help young people with disabilities to get a job. I’ve just retired and started spending more time on my hobbies, such as singing, reading, and playing volleyball.",

I’ve been a computer programmer in the states for about 30 years, but don’t worry: I don’t have the dusty haircut, oversized buttoned shirt and nerdie big frame glasses. I am a member of a group called World War Ethusiasts- we recreate and discuss things a war related. Cheers, John",
